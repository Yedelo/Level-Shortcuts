# Level Shortcuts

Adds a shortcut to access different levels

---

Adds a shortcut to the title screen to access your favorite levels with **ONE** click of a button instead of like **THREE**!

Actually pretty useful if you're playing a gauntlet level (saves two -> three entire clicks).

Supported areas:

- Editor levels
- Online levels
- Daily/weekly/event levels
- Gauntlet levels
